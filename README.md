Social Media Data Set 


I created a new Metadata because the old one lacked vital information. I added README, Metadata.xml,TotalHealthyData.cvs and “Technology enabled Health”–Insights from twitter analytics with a socio-technical perspective (This is the correct title and format of the article as published). I will added the rough draft of my paper by 3/7/2021. 
Nakala is the repository I chose for my data set. Nakala allows research teams and academic scholars to file their digital data (text files, sound, image, video) in a secure warehouse. Nakala is a full Web application and a repository for humanities and social sciences. It's created and powered in France by Huma-Num, the french infrastructure for digital humanities.

Every day millions of people use social media, such as Twitter, to connect to other people with similar health issues. Twitter collects, analyzes, and stores all data used on its platform. They share the collected data with external sources, such as social media researchers, while also offering analytic tools for use on their data. This repository project aims to provide information on the curation process of Grover, Kar, and Davies' data set of tweets that focused on discussions about health and technology on Twitter. 

Grover, Kar, and Davies collected tweets as their data to study users' behavior on discussing health issues with technology. The data set does not contain any restrictions on the use of it. Figshare.com displays the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC By 4.0), meaning the data set is free to use, copy, share, and adapt in any format for personal, commercial, and research use for the data set. Unfortunately, the data set is incomplete the study's time frame for the data collection.
