Social Media Data Set 
I created a new Metadata because the old one lacked vital information. I added TotalHealthyData.cvs and “Technology enabled Health”–Insights from twitter analytics with a socio-technical perspective (This is the correct title and format of the article). I will added the rough draft of my paper by 3/7/2021. 
I never found the time scope for the data collection. 

Every day millions of people use social media, such as Twitter, to connect to other people with similar health issues. Twitter collects, analyzes, and stores all data used on its platform. They share the collected data with external sources, such as social media researchers, while also offering analytic tools for use on their data. This repository project aims to provide information on the curation process of Grover, Kar, and Davies' data set of tweets that focused on discussions about health and technology on Twitter. 

Grover, Kar, and Davies collected tweets as their data to study users' behavior on discussing health issues with technology. The data set does not contain any restrictions on the use of it. Figshare.com displays the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC By 4.0), meaning the data set is free to use, copy, share, and adapt in any format for personal, commercial, and research use for the data set. Unfortunately, the data set is incomplete because it lacks the data sample, the study's time frame, the methodology, and the stakeholders' information. 

The data sample consists of 105,489 tweets from 15,587 unique users, which is defined as people who discussed health issues with technology on Twitter. Gover, Kar, and Davies employed social media analytics from Twitter, such as the CUP Framework with word analysis, network analysis, and hashtag analysis, as the scientific methods used for the data collection, the data analysis, and the data presentation. Gover, Kar, and Davies used these six hashtags: #healthtech, #digitalhealth, #mhealth, #medtech, #healthit, and #ehealth to identify conversations from Twitter for their research. The actor-network theory is used to view the data because it treats humans and technology as inseparable. The stakeholders who will benefit from the research are health educators, internet users, marketing firms, health technology companies, health-oriented companies, the medical profession, and the government. 

Here is a list of keywords I added the Metadat to increase visibility.
